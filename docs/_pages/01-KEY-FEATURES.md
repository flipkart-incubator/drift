***Drift*** is a Temporal-powered, low-code workflow orchestration platform that enables users to design, deploy, and execute workflows using **[native reusable nodes](/02-TERMINOLOGIES/#1-native-nodes)**. The platform abstracts the complexity of workflow creation and management, provides a flexible, extensible architecture for building business flows, and also offers an easy, user-friendly way to interact with workflows.

### Key Features
- **Low-Code/No-Code**: Create workflows on-the-fly with predefined native nodes.
- **DSL-Based workflow**: Defines the workflow structure by stitching nodes in a Directed Graph. Executes mostly as a sequential DAG, with explicit support for loops to handle complex logic.
- **Temporal Integration**: For durable, fault-tolerant workflow execution.
- **Workflow Versioning**: Version-controlled workflows with hot deployments, zero downtime updates and rollbacks.
- **Real-time Visibility**: Live workflow execution tracking and monitoring.
- **Widgetized Responses**: UI-ready responses for human-in-the-loop workflows and systematic resumes.
- **Generic Contracts**: Standardized contracts for seamless data flow.
- **Interaction Modes**: Supports both sync and async modes of workflow interactions.
